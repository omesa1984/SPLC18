		<h2>1. Types of Vulnerabilities</h2>

		<p>
			Vulnerability, <a
				href="http://eguimaraes15.github.io/index.html#fowler">[1]</a>,
			 is a weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information 
			 assurance. Vulnerability is the intersection of three elements: a system 
			 susceptibility or flaw, attacker access to the flaw, and attacker capability 
			 to exploit the flaw <a
				href="http://eguimaraes15.github.io/index.html#marinescu">[2]</a>).
			We present the Types of Vulnerabilities following:

		</p>
		<div class="questions">
			<blockquote>
				<li><strong> XSS (Cross-site Scripting): </strong> the attacker manages to 
				hide a malicious code from users, making it look like application components, 
				and waits for user activation to execute it;</li>
					
				<li><strong> SQL Injection: </strong> the attacker takes advantage of the 
				lack of data validation and execute SQL queries from the client's writing components</li>
				
				<li><strong> Directory traversal: </strong> it allows attackers to access 
				restricted directories and execute commands outside of the web server’s root directory</li>
				
				<li><strong> CSRF (Cross-site Request Forgery): </strong> the attackers abuse
				 the trust of the users on the website and use their permission for the attack</li>
				
				<li><strong> Bypass: </strong>the attacker takes advantage of an alternate 
				access path left in place by developers, or flaws in the website design</li>
				
				<li><strong> Parameter Remote File (PRF): </strong> REFAZER</li>
				
				<li><strong> Open Redirect: </strong> it allows the attackers to redirect 
				users to arbitrary websites while executing phishing attacks</li>
				
				<li><strong> Video Embed & Thumbnail Generator (VETG): </strong> it allows the attackers to
				 execute arbitrary commands through unspecified vectors</li>
				
				<li><strong>  Information Disclosure (Inf. Disc.): </strong> it allows attackers 
				to obtain information on the configuration through a direct request to the configuration file</li>
				
				<li><strong>  Multiple Unspecified Vulnerabilities (MUV): </strong> these are
				 vulnerabilities of multiple and unspecified impact</li>
				
			</blockquote>						
		</div>
		<p>
		The types of vulnerabilities were identified by the description that each one presents 
		in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) repository. The text is necessary to 
		the description of the vulnerability and your registration in the repository. 
		The most comprehensive descriptions mention the type of vulnerability, 
		the plug-in where the vulnerability is located and even the files in which it was 
		necessary to perform some operation to correct the vulnerability. 
		In all the descriptions they identify the plug-ins where the vulnerability is presented,
		 it is necesary data for our study and in which we will cover later. The poorer descriptions 
		 are limited to naming the plug-in, which is why we need to identify the vulnerability 
		 by the interpretation the text and parallel research in the bibliography related to the terms.

		<div id="applications">
			<h2>2. Most frequent Vulnerabilities caused by WordPress plug-ins</h2>
			<p>After make a study by the vulnerabilities registered; we identify, 
			group and account the vulnerabilities by type. We counted and studied 139 
			vulnerabilities, which we identified and defined briefly in the previous section. 
			Untill the date, the most commonly reported vulnerabilities are of type XSS. 
			Were registred 76 vulnerabilities, it is represented more than 50% of registered vulnerabilities. 
			The second most frequent vulnerability is the SQL Injection, a total of 24 representing just over 15%. 
			The rest of types of vulnerabilities have a lower frequency of occurrence, does not reach 10% of 
			occurrence but this does not detract from either importance or relevance because these characteristics 
			depend on the severity of their impact and not on their frequency of occurrence.

		The repository shows CVSS severity versions 2.0 and 3.0 vulnerability assessments. 
		All the vulnerabilities present the evaluations by the metrics of the Version 2.0,

		Version 3.0. In many cases the quantitative results shown by the metrics show slight 
		variations and in other cases the differences are greater. While qualitative assessments 
		are different in many occasions. We understand that these variations are a result of 
		the optimization in the applied metrics, the addition of new metrics or the division

		As expected, we found a great variety in the Base Score field, some as low as CVE-2013-4954

		Until this moment we appreciate that not being to find a vulnerability of little 
		occurrence this must be ignored. The <i>Figure 3</i> shows how the <i>MUV</i> vulnerability 
		has a single occurrence in the research carried out but was evaluated high, so that 
		it has a high Score average, until this time the highest average.		
						
		<p>
		Of the ten (10) types of vulnerabilities identified, three (3) of them have a high 
		average impact on application integrity, caused by the addition of a plug-in. <i>MUV, 
		PRF, and SQL Injection</i> vulnerabilities maintain a <strong>Score</strong> average 
		of <strong>7.0</strong> or higher; this leads to a wake-up call for developers to take 
		care of the appearance of these vulnerabilities in their applications.
		
		<p>
		For to calculate the average of the Score of the types of vulnerabilities, when we 
		found the Score of CVSS 3.0 we despise the Score obtained of CVSS 2.0.
		
		<p>
		We must emphasize that the type of vulnerability <i>XSS</i>, which has the highest 
		frequency of occurrence, and is the lowest vulnerability. Its <strong>Score</strong>
		 values are very stable and are evaluated from <strong>Medium</strong>, and on a few occasions 
		 from <strong>Low</strong>. The problem of vulnerabilities of type <i>XSS</i> is that they are very 
		 frequent, reason for they are the most looked for to realize the attacks. Its high frequency of appearance 
		 leads to constant care by the developers <i>Figure 3</i>.

		Of the 139 vulnerability descriptions analyzed, we observed  that in only 14 was evaluate
		 as <strong>None</strong>, they are not significant compromise of the integrity of the web 
		 application. While in 9 the affectation was classified as <strong>Low</strong>. For the most 
		 part the developers reported the possibility of unrestricted access to some files or certain 
		 information of the web application, but in these cases the scope of what the attackers was assessed 
		 limited. Finally, we observed in 4 of the vulnerabilities severely compromised <strong>(High)</strong> 
		 the application while another 1 <strong>Completely</strong> compromised the integrity of the application.
		
		<p>
		Analyzing the impact of the vulnerabilities in the availability of web applications, 
		we observed that in only 3 of the 139, that the developers considered the possibility of 
		a compromise in the performance or <strong>High</strong> interruption in the available resources.
		 Again we have 1 that compromises the resources of the application in its entirety. Of the remaining 
		 only 40 have a <strong>Partial</strong> risk of the resources of the applications, the rest does not presents risks.
		
		<p>
		We analyze the field describing the complexity of the attack that must be performed to exploit the 
		identified vulnerabilities without taking into account the attacker's experience. In this metric 
		we noticed that in 1 of the vulnerabilities the complexity of the attack to be carried out is 
		very low (<strong>None</strong>) and another 61 were evaluated from <strong>Low</strong>. We 
		find 2 vulnerabilities that need a <strong>High</strong> level of knowledge of the atancante,

		The <i>Table 4</i> compiles the most significant data, mentioned above, to facilitate the understanding of the partial conclusions. The fields <strong>Integrity</strong> and <strong>Availability</strong> are correlated. It is easy to see that the evaluations of the fields <strong>Integrity</strong> and <strong>Availability</strong> are directly proportional to the field <strong>Base Score</strong>, while the field <strong>Confidentiality</strong> is inversely proportional. As the level of amemaza of the integrity of the application increases, the lack of security in the access to the resources that guarantee the operation of the application increases. The increase of these fields degrades the confidentiality of the application. In the rest of the vulnerabilities these fields present the same relation and behavior. Up to this point we can conclude that the fields <strong>Integrity</strong>, <strong>Availability</strong> and <strong>Confidentiality</strong> have direct influence in the field <strong>Base Score</strong>.

			In another of the metrics we have an idea of the effort that the developers must 
			make to solve a vulnerability caused by the addition of a plug-ins. To solve the
			 139 vulnerabilities studied it was necessary to work witd a total of 7626 as 
			 reflected in <i>Table 5</i>. The <i>Table 5</i> shows the total number of files 
			 that needed to be <strong>Added</strong>, <strong>Deleted</strong> or <strong>Edited</strong> to

			 since in the cases of the modified files the repository shows the modifications that were made. 
			 As you can see in the column <strong>Used</strong> only those files related directly to the vulnerability correction were counted.
			
			<p>
			As our study is aimed at the vulnerabilities produced by the addition of WordPress 
			plug-ins, in a file containing <i>PHP</i> codes, we independently count the files 
			with <i>PHP</i>, <i>JS</i> and <i>HTML</i> extension that were used in the correction 
			process. During the process of counting and filtering of the files by extension we group 
			all the possible files of extensions <i>JS and JSP</i> in a group of files <i>JS</i>; 
			and the <i>HTA, HTM, HTML, XML, MHT and MHTML</i> extension files are grouped into 
			the <i>HTML</i> group. All percent data shown in <i>Table 5</i> were calculated using

			As a conclusion we summarize that to solve a vulnerability we need to add 47 files, modify another 5, and delete 1 file for every 208 files; all are approximate values. In the case of the modified we could say that approximately 2 files would be used per vulnerability. If we make the same reflection but only attending to the extensions that concern us for our investigation, only those files witd PHP, JS and HTML extensions, reduce slightly the amounts of files that we would have to use. In this case 15 files would be added, 1 file would be modified for every 13 that the application contains and 1 file would be deleted for every 592 files. Only 1 out of 26 files would be used.
			
			<p>
			We could say that the effort to correct the vulnerability is not much if we consider that the developer who makes the correction is that gave rise to the application, which favors the recognition of the causes and origin of the vulnerability. On the other hand if the developer who makes the correction did not participate in its creation, although it has a lot of knowledge that has the language and WordPress has to make a greater effort and interact witd many files.

			<h2>6. Data Collection</h2>
			<p>
			Knowing that for WordPress there are more than 50 thousand plug-ins available and is widely used by the developer community, we set ourselves the task of identifying those plug-ins related to the registered vulnerabilities. For this process we once again covered the description of each vulnerability to indetify the plug-ins. We identified a total of 110 different plug-ins, which does not represent 1% of the total number of plug-ins known for WordPress.

			<p>
			The low percentage of plug-ins related to the vulnerabilities registered in the NVD repository led to the search for more details and found that 17 of them were found on more than one occasion representing almost 15,45 % of the total number of identified plug-ins. The other 93 plug-ins were only listed on one occasion witd one of the vulnerabilities (Figure 4).

			<p align="center">
			<img src="./SPLC18/logo/total_plugin.PNG" align="center" height="250" width="300">
			<p align="center">
			<caption><i>Figure 4</i></caption>
			
			<p>
			We use the website WordPress.org to investigate the characteristics of the identified plug-ings. The referenced website offers various details about each plug-in. It offers details like: a description of the functionalities of each plug-in, the evaluations of all those users and developers evaluated them, installation instructions and version registration. The Figure 5 shows that over 50% of the identified plug-ins were evaluated witd 4 stars or more.
			
			<p align="center">
			<th><img src="./SPLC18/logo/stars_plugin.PNG" align="center" height="250" width="350"></td>
			<p align="center">
			<caption><i>Figure 5</i></caption>

			<p>
			The <i>Figure 6</i> gives importance to our study taking into account that the 110 plug-ins found in the 139 different vulnerabilities were evaluated by 16,254 WordPress developers. More than 95% gave evaluations of four (4) or more stars to the detected plug-ins. On average each plug-in was evaluated by approximately 147 users.

			<th><img src="./SPLC18/logo/evaluators_plugin.PNG" align="center" height="250" width="300"></td>
			<p align="center">
			<caption><i>Figure 6</i></caption>
			
			<p>
			Doing a study similar to the one of the plug-ins but this time with the files we could observe that in several occasions, some of the files are modified or revised in more than one opportunity. This time we decided to only count those files that were modified to solve the vulnerabilities identified, we are talking about the files that were made possible in the column <strong>Used</strong> of <i>Table 5</i>. Of the total of 186 files that intervened in the solution of the vulnerability we have to 10% of the files were repeated on more than one occasion (<i>Figure 7</i>).
			
			<p align="center">
			<img src="./SPLC18/logo/total_file.PNG" align="center" height="250" width="300">
			<p align="center">
			<caption><i>Figure 7</i></caption>
			
			<p>
			From the information offered by the previous figure and the study we can generate the following possible conclusions or new questions.
			
			<p>
			<blockquote>
				<li>First: the first time the file was modified, the proposed solution did not correctly resolve the vulnerability and triggered other patches and fixes.</li>
				<li>Second: Modifying a vulnerability could have caused the existence of another vulnerability, in the same or another plug-in.</li>
				<li>Third: During the process of fixing a vulnerability, developers can add or modify files that are not related to the vulnerability to be solved. This process can generate new vulnerabilities or prevent the proposed solution from being efficient.</li>
				
			</blockquote>

			<p>
			These variants for future work show that much remains to be explored in the world of vulnerabilities and even more to make the developers aware of the importance of watching for the occurrences of vulnerabilities in the applications that are generated to facilitate our day to day.

			<h2>7. Difficulties Encountered</h2>
			
			<p>
			During the study realized in the NVD repository we find several difficulties that hinder our study, difficulties caused by the lack of data and we will describe in this section.
			
			<p>
			At first we find 2 vulnerabilities that do not present classification of the group of vulnerabilities to which they belong, and nor do they offer indications for the search, interpretation or identification of the same. We searched in Internet used the identifier of each vulnerability, trying to identify other repositories that will facilitate the process, but all the repositories found report the same information and in some cases less information. The vulnerabilities in this case are:
			
			<blockquote>
				<li>CVE-2013-2204</li>
				<li>CVE-2012-4422</li>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>
			Other difficulties encountered were those vulnerabilities that do not make references to the plugins that were originated. Some of them offer several data but if any indicates the files that have to be modified, it must be very common files between the various plugins or own of WordPres and not of the plugins. In this case we find the vulnerabilities:
			
			<blockquote>
				<li>CVE-2016-6896</li>
				<li>CVE-2012-4422</li>
				<li>CVE-2012-2402</li>
				<li>CVE-2006-5705</li>
			</blockquote>
			
			<p>
			We find a larger group of vulnerabilities that do not provide data about how they should be corrected, what correction to make or patch to use. Whenever we did an internet search for a possible solution for these vulnerabilities we ended up circling between a different links that were showed in the pages found <i>Table 6</i>.

			<caption><i>Table 6</i></caption>
			
			<p>
			As a curiosity we observed that the 7 vulnerabilities caused by the use of the plugins that were registered in 2008 are in this group of vulnerabilities that do not show solution; the 5 of these vulnerabilities shows updated information during the last month of September 2017, which indicates that the community is working on the solution of these vulnerabilities. The 5 of them have <strong>Medium</strong> severity level and the other 2 level of <str>High</strong> gravity, were identified as <strong>SQL Injection</strong> and are associated with the <strong><i>FooGallery</i></strong> and <strong><i>Newsletter</i></strong> plugins.
			
			<p>
			In the <i>Table 6</i> we show that the vulnerability </strong>CVE-2009-2334</strong> is shown when combining the plugins <strong><i>Collapsing Archives, Akismet, Related Ways to Take Action, Acunetix Secure WordPress and Acunetix WP Security</i></strong>. On the other hand all the variables indicate that the vulnerability <strong>CVE-2008-0618</strong> can be produced by any of the plugins <strong><i>Gwolle Guestbook or Rizzi Guestbook</i></strong>.
			
			<p>
			We detected 2 vulnerabilities produced not by the use of a plugin but by the elimination of some of them. In these cases, the vulnerabilities also offer no indication of which plugin can cause these disasters to be eliminated. The vulnerability <strong>CVE-2010-5295</strong> was only necessary to modify 1 file but in the vulnerability <strong>CVE-2017-6816</strong> was necessary to modify 49 files to correct the vulnerability caused by deleting the plugin or plugins
